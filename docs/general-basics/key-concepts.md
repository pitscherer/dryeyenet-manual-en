# Key Concepts

DryEyeNet organizes work into guided flows we call **workflows**:

- **New exam** — baseline documentation (patient data + medication + anamnesis + questionnaires + attachments).
- **New treatment** — documentation of a performed treatment visit (typically requires an existing exam).
- **Dashboard** — search patients, review documentation, and correct/complete previous visits.
- ..

Each **workflow** consists of sequential steps. A **Cancel** button is available throughout to safely abort the flow and return to the Main Menu.

**Terms used in this manual:**

- **Step:** one screen within a flow.
- **Substep:** a dialog or nested screen within a step (e.g., Add patient).
- **Review:** the final step where you confirm data completeness before saving.

# Access, Roles and Permissions

The system is role-based. Depending on the role you are assigned:

- Some menu entries may be hidden
- Some steps may be read-only
- Some actions (e.g., treatment planning) may be restricted

If you do not see a feature described in this manual, check your role permissions with your administrator.
