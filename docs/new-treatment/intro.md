# Documenting a Treatment

Each treatment record is linked to a previously assigned **Treatment Plan**.

To document a treatment:

1. Select the patient.
2. Select the treatment plan assigned to that patient.
3. Complete the treatment documentation.

The sections available in the treatment documentation depend on the selected treatment plan.
