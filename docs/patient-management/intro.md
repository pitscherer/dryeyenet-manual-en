# Patient Management

You can create and edit patients from more than one location within **DryEyeNet**.

- **Patient Dashboard**

  The most straightforward way is to go to the patient dashboard. In the bottom menu, you will find the option to add a new patient.  
  To edit an existing patient, first select the patient; the **Edit** option will then appear in the bottom menu.

  Please note that in **DryEyeNet**, each patient has their own user account for accessing the patient portal.

Once selected the patient you will have all the actions available over the patient:

- **Substeps in Workflows**

  When creating a new **Base Survey**, the first step is to select an existing patient or create a new one.  
  This provides access to the option to create a patient directly from the bottom menu.
